# Nginx Watch

## Overview

Tired of constantly changing sessions/tabs to edit your server config while developing on Nginx?
Nginx Watch to the rescue!

Nginx Watch enables you to save nginx config (hosts) files within your projects/web directory,
allowing for portability and a more efficient work flow... Not to mention the auto-reload feature.

*The closest thing to Nginx .htaccess*

## Features

* Minimal with attention to performance
* Watch configured directory (web root) for nginx config files
* Automatically updates the Nginx 'include' list
* Auto-reload Nginx when a config file has changed
* If an error occurs, the specified user will be alerted via an active session
